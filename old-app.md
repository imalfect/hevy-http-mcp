# hevy-mcp: Model Context Protocol Server for Hevy Fitness API

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that interfaces with the [Hevy fitness tracking app](https://www.hevyapp.com/) and its [API](https://api.hevyapp.com/docs/). This server enables AI assistants to access and manage workout data, routines, exercise templates, and more through the Hevy API (requires PRO subscription).

## Features

- **Workout Management**: Fetch, create, and update workouts
- **Routine Management**: Access and manage workout routines
- **Exercise Templates**: Browse available exercise templates
- **Folder Organization**: Manage routine folders
- **Webhook Subscriptions**: Create, view, and delete webhook subscriptions for workout events

> **Note:** HTTP transport and Docker images are deprecated. The server runs via stdio transport (e.g., `npx hevy-mcp`). Legacy GHCR images remain available but are no longer maintained.

## Quick start

Pick the workflow that fits your setup:

| Scenario | Command | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One-off stdio run | `HEVY_API_KEY=sk_live... npx -y hevy-mcp` | Node.js ≥ 20, Hevy API key |
| Local development | `pnpm install && pnpm run dev` | `.env` with `HEVY_API_KEY`, pnpm via Corepack |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher; strongly recommended to use the exact version pinned in
  `.nvmrc` to match CI)
- pnpm (via Corepack)
- A Hevy API key

## Installation

### Run via npx (recommended)

You can launch the server directly without cloning:

```bash
HEVY_API_KEY=your_hevy_api_key_here npx -y hevy-mcp
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp.git
cd hevy-mcp

# Install dependencies
corepack use pnpm@10.22.0
pnpm install

# Create .env and add your keys (never commit real keys)
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env and add your HEVY_API_KEY.
```

### Integration with Cursor

To use this MCP server with Cursor, add/merge this server entry under
`"mcpServers"` in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "hevy-mcp": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "hevy-mcp"],
    "env": {
      "HEVY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Hevy API key.

If your `mcp.json` already contains other servers, do not replace the whole
file—merge the `"hevy-mcp"` entry into your existing `"mcpServers"` object.

The `"hevy-mcp"` key name is arbitrary. If you already have an existing config
using a different name (for example `"hevy-mcp-server"`), you can keep it.

If you already have an existing `"mcpServers"` object, merge the `"hevy-mcp"`
entry into it without removing other servers.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hevy-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "hevy-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HEVY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>


## Configuration

You can supply your Hevy API key in two ways:

1. Environment variable (`HEVY_API_KEY`)
2. Command-line argument (`--hevy-api-key=your_key` or `hevy-api-key=your_key` after `--` when using pnpm scripts)

Create a `.env` file in the project root (you can copy from [.env.sample](.env.sample)) with the following content if using the environment variable approach:

```env
HEVY_API_KEY=your_hevy_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_hevy_api_key_here` with your actual Hevy API key. If you prefer the command argument approach you can skip setting the environment variable and start the server with for example:

```bash
pnpm start -- --hevy-api-key=your_hevy_api_key_here
```

### Sentry monitoring

`hevy-mcp` ships with Sentry monitoring baked into the built MCP server so
that usage and errors from published builds can be observed.

The server initializes `@sentry/node` with a fixed DSN, release name derived
from the package version, and tracing settings
directly in the code (see `src/index.ts`), and wraps the underlying
`McpServer` with `Sentry.wrapMcpServerWithSentry` so requests and tool calls
are captured by Sentry automatically. The configuration uses
`sendDefaultPii: false` to keep Sentry's default PII collection disabled.

There is currently no built-in toggle to disable Sentry for the published
package. If you need a build without Sentry telemetry, you can fork the
repository and remove the Sentry initialization in `src/index.ts`.

## Transport


### Stdio Only (Current)

**As of version 1.18.0, hevy-mcp only supports stdio transport.** HTTP/SSE
transport has been completely removed.

hevy-mcp runs exclusively over stdio, which works seamlessly with MCP-aware clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor. The server communicates via standard input/output streams using JSON-RPC messages.

### Migration from HTTP/SSE Transport

**If you were using HTTP or SSE transport in an older version (< 1.18.0), you must migrate to stdio.**

The HTTP/SSE transport was removed in v1.18.0 to simplify the codebase and focus
on the stdio-native MCP experience. If you're encountering errors like:

- `"stream is not readable"` when making HTTP requests
- `"HTTP transport mode has been removed from hevy-mcp"`
- Server messages about SSE mode on `http://localhost:3001`

You are likely running an outdated build or trying to connect with an HTTP-based client. Here's how to fix it:

#### Steps to Migrate:

1. **Update to the latest version:**
   ```bash
   npx -y hevy-mcp@latest
   # or if installed locally:
   pnpm install hevy-mcp@latest
   ```

2. **Update your client configuration** to use stdio transport instead of HTTP. For example, in Cursor's `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:
   
   **Old HTTP-based config (no longer supported):**
   ```json
   {
     "hevy-mcp": {
       "url": "http://localhost:3001/sse"
     }
   }
   ```
   
   **New stdio-based config (current):**
   ```json
   {
     "hevy-mcp": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": ["-y", "hevy-mcp"],
       "env": {
         "HEVY_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Clear any cached builds:**
   ```bash
   # If you have a local clone, rebuild
   pnpm run build
   
   # Or remove node_modules and reinstall
   rm -rf node_modules dist
   pnpm install
   pnpm run build
   ```

4. **Ensure you're not running a custom HTTP server.** If you have custom code that imports `createHttpServer()`, it will now throw an error. Remove those imports and use stdio transport instead.

If you absolutely need HTTP/SSE transport, you can use version `1.17.x` or earlier, but those versions are no longer maintained and contain known bugs (including the "stream is not readable" issue caused by middleware conflicts).

## Usage

### Development

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This starts the MCP server in development mode with hot reloading.

### Production

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm start
```

### Docker (deprecated)

Docker-based workflows have been retired so we can focus on the stdio-native experience. The bundled `Dockerfile` now exits with a clear message to prevent accidental builds, and `.dockerignore` simply documents the deprecation. Previously published images remain available on GHCR (for example `ghcr.io/chrisdoc/hevy-mcp:latest`), but they are **no longer updated**. For the best experience, run the server locally via `npx hevy-mcp` or your own Node.js runtime.

## Development Guide

### Code Style

This project uses Biome for code formatting and linting:

```bash
pnpm run check
```

### Testing

#### Run All Tests

To run all tests (unit and integration), use:

```bash
pnpm test
```

> **Note:** `pnpm test` runs **all** tests. Integration tests will fail by design if
> `HEVY_API_KEY` is missing. If you don’t have an API key locally, use the unit
> test command below.

#### Run Only Unit Tests

To run only unit tests (excluding integration tests):

```bash
pnpm vitest run --exclude tests/integration/**
```

Or with coverage:

```bash
pnpm vitest run --coverage --exclude tests/integration/**
```

#### Run Only Integration Tests

To run only the integration tests (requires a valid `HEVY_API_KEY`):

```bash
pnpm vitest run tests/integration
```

**Note:** The integration tests will fail if the `HEVY_API_KEY` environment variable is not set. This is by design to ensure that the tests are always run with a valid API key.

##### GitHub Actions Configuration

For GitHub Actions:

1. Unit + integration tests are executed as part of the normal `Build and Test` workflow
2. Integration tests require the `HEVY_API_KEY` secret to be set

The workflow runs `pnpm vitest run --coverage` and provides `HEVY_API_KEY` from
repository secrets.

To set up the `HEVY_API_KEY` secret:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
3. Click on "New repository secret"
4. Set the name to `HEVY_API_KEY` and the value to your Hevy API key
5. Click "Add secret"

If the secret is not set, the integration tests will fail (by design).

To set up Sentry secrets for source map uploads during builds:

The build process uses Sentry's Rollup plugin to upload source maps. You need to configure three secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
3. Add the following secrets:
   - `SENTRY_ORG`: Your Sentry organization slug
   - `SENTRY_PROJECT`: Your Sentry project slug
   - `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`: A Sentry auth token with `project:releases` scope

   You can create a Sentry auth token at: https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/

If these secrets are not set, the build will still succeed, but source maps will not be uploaded to Sentry.

Note: GitHub does not provide secrets to pull requests from forks by default, so
fork PRs may fail CI unless a maintainer reruns the checks with `HEVY_API_KEY`
available.

If CI is failing only because the fork PR is missing `HEVY_API_KEY`, that is
expected; maintainers may rerun the workflow with secrets enabled.

For contributors from forks: CI failures caused solely by missing `HEVY_API_KEY`
do not indicate a problem with your changes.

All other CI checks (build, formatting/linting, unit tests, etc.) are still
expected to pass.

Only failures caused solely by missing `HEVY_API_KEY` on forked PRs are
considered acceptable.

### Generating API Client

The API client is generated from the OpenAPI specification using [Kubb](https://kubb.dev/):

```bash
pnpm run export-specs
pnpm run build:client
```

Kubb generates TypeScript types, API clients, Zod schemas, and mock data from the OpenAPI specification.

### Troubleshooting

- **Rollup optional dependency missing**: If you see an error similar to `Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`, set the environment variable `ROLLUP_SKIP_NODEJS_NATIVE_BUILD=true` before running `pnpm run build`. This forces Rollup to use the pure JavaScript fallback and avoids the npm optional dependency bug on some Linux runners.
